/*
 * Description of the new ElfWeaver output file.
 *
 * The file is a series of records described below, each describing an
 * operation.  These operations are read sequentially and are executed
 * as soon as they are read.  The first record must be an OP_HEADER
 * record and the last must be an OP_END record.
 *
 * Each record is of variable size.  The size field contains the
 * offset in bytes from the start of one record to the next.
 *
 * Certain operations create objects and these objects are assigned to
 * the supplied names.  These names are simple integers that must be
 * unique.  ElfWeaver is responsible for the allocation of these
 * names.  Execution aborts if two objects are created with the same
 * name or if a record refers to a name that has not been assigned to
 * earlier or refers to an unexpected type.
 *
 * The operations are:
 *
 * 1) OP_HEADER
 *
 * Describes the file.  The fields are:
 *
 * a) magic
 *
 * Always 0x1960021d

 *
 * Version of the file format.  Currently 5.
 *
 * c) debug
 *
 * For future use and must be 0.
