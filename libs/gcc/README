README libgcc

This project is NOT meant to be explicitly exported.  None of these
functions are meant to be explicitly used.  These are the functions
that are included with libgcc, but cannot use the original version
due to static/dynamic library incompatibility.

You are required to include this library in your list of libraries to link,
however, if gcc implicitly emits code that makes use of these functions.

These functions originate from the klibc library by
Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>.
