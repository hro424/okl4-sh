     * Eventually, the first pointer will hit the end of the chain (and
     * we know we are deadlock free), or it will hit the second pointer.
     * If it hits the second pointer, we know that (i) there is a loop;
     * (ii) the second pointer is inside the loop; and (iii) the length

     * moved since we last changed the position of the second pointer.

     * length of 'mu' by having two pointers length 'lamda' away from
     * each other both moving along the chain. After 'mu' steps, the two
     * pointers will collide and we will have finished.
