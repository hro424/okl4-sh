This file contains a grab-bag of requirements for elfweaver. Ideally
elfweaver will support all of these.

1. Alignment specification. Default and per object.

2. Produce the same output from identical input across systems.
(Problems with old dite which had uninitialised data in the final
image, which could be different on different runs or different
operating systems.)

3. Order of segments in output file must be possible.

4. Able to manipulate segment flags.

5. Support the latest ELF standard.

6. Allow specification of arbitrary regions of memory.

7. Provide  a memory usage report when building an image.

8. Ideally XML parsing should be extensible and allow easy adding of
new tags and features, without needing in-depth parsing knowledge.
