    A memory allocator.

    This allocator is based on the first fit algorithm with an
    interface tuned to the rather strange requirements of elfweaver.

    The allocator keeps a sorted list of free address ranges.  Each
    range is a multiple of <min_alloc_size> bytes (aka a page), and is
    aligned on a <min_alloc_size> boundary.

    Separate calls to the allocator will result in items being
    allocated in different pages.  However it is possible to allocate
    items on adjacent bytes, provided that that are part of the same
    allocation group.

    Allocation groups are a method of allocating multiple items at one
    time and ensuring that they are placed sufficiently close to one
    another.  Some items in a group may already have their addresses
    set (for instance, allocating a stack near a program's text
    segment).  These items must have addresses that are not in the
    allocator's free list.

    An individual item will be placed at the lowest address that
    satify its size, offset and alignment requirements.  Items in a
    group are allocated in increasing order of address.

    Memory at a particular address can be removed from the free list
    with the mark() method.  It is not an error to mark memory that is
    wholly or in part missing from the free list.

    A window of memory can also be marked with the mark_window()
    method.  A window is similar to regular marking, except that it is
    an error for the region of memory to contain memory outside of the
    freelist unless those regions are present in a list supplied to
    the method.  The entire memory region must have once been present
