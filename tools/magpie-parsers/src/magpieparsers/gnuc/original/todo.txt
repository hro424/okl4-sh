Some ideas of what to do next:

     Use 2.7.0's non-greedy loops.
     Optimize the rules--I'm sure I missed some simple optimizations.
     Examples which actually do a transformation.
     Verify and improve #line handling
     Better source code emitting scheme--email Monty (jamz@cdsnet.net) about his ideas.  Should be able to preserve comments, etc.
     Maybe re-organize the tree structure to be easier to manipulate.
     Add some helper methods for tree transformations for adding or removing code, etc.
