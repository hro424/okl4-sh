 * RVCT parses inline assembly blocks, and does not support the
 * 'LDRT' instruction (See "ARM DUI 0205H", Section 6, Page 7.)
 *
 * The problem is that LDRT requires that the register containing
 * the pointer to the user-memory address _must_ be different to
 * the pointer carrying out the load. Failure to do this results
 * in "UNPREDICTABLE" behaviour according to the ARM architecture
 * reference manual, and results in data corruption and processor
 * lockups (!) in real life.
 *
 * RVCT provides no way of specifying such a register allocation
 * requirement unfortunately, but insists on performing its own
 * register allocation. Hence the need for this file.
